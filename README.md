**Jenkins.NET**

Jenkins.NET is an open-source portable class library for retrieving information from the Jenkins continuous integration server ([http://www.jenkins-ci.org](http://www.jenkins-ci.org)). It wraps the XML-flavoured API with asynchronous calls

Jenkins.NET currently supports .NET 4.5, Silverlight 4 and higher, Windows Phone 7.5 and higher, and .NET for Windows Store apps.

Please feel free to download and use the library in Jenkins applications, and contribute by submitting issues and discussion to help me enhance Jenkins.NET.

** This project is not maintained as I'm not working day-to-day with .NET any more. Feel free to submit pull requests for new functionality and/or fixes! **
